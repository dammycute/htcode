### Option 2: Story-Driven

```
Remember yesterday when I said "link drops tomorrow"?

Here it is: [YOUR-PORTFOLIO-URL-HERE]

This isn't just a portfolio. It's a commitment tracker.

26 weeks of building.
52 full-stack projects.
Real-time updates.
No hiding.

✅ Week 1: Portfolio + Blog API (In Progress)
📍 Week 2: URL Shortener + Typing Effect
🎯 Weeks 3-26: More backend + frontend projects

Every project tracked. Every update logged.
You can literally watch me build in real-time.

The accountability starts now.

### Option 3: Value-Focused (Recommended)

```
Portfolio site is live. 🌐

But here's what makes it different:

Instead of showing what I've built,
it shows what I'm BUILDING.

Live tracking:
→ Current projects (Week 1: Blog API in-progress)
→ Weekly progress updates
→ Tech stack for each project
→ Challenges & how I solved them

Built with:
Next.js 16 | React | Tailwind CSS | File-based backend

Check it out: [YOUR-PORTFOLIO-URL-HERE]

Features:
✨ Dynamic project feed
✨ Monthly archive system
✨ Admin panel (for me to update daily)
✨ No database needed

The goal?
26 weeks. 52 projects. Building in public.

Week 1: ✅ Portfolio done, Backend API in progress
Week 2: URL Shortener + Typing Effect (starts Monday)

Follow along if you want to see someone actually shipping consistently 🚀

### Option 4: Technical Deep Dive

```
Portfolio deployed. Here's the tech behind it 🛠️

Live: [YOUR-PORTFOLIO-URL-HERE]

Built in 1 week with:
→ Next.js 16 (App Router)
→ React Server Components
→ Tailwind CSS v4

→ File-based backend (no DB!)
→ localStorage auth

Cool features:
✅ Real-time project tracking

The twist?
It's not a static portfolio. It's a live build tracker.

26 weeks of projects.
Updated as I build.
100% transparent.
